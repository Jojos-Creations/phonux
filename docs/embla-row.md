# The row on Embla Carousel

Owner ruling, 2026-11-08: rebuild the row on Embla Carousel now (rc.7 waits); far-off pages sit on one continuous strip, with
far web pages unloaded behind same-size placeholders (step 7). The plan is `~/git/phonux-rc7-pack/embla-plan/PLAN.md` (eight
steps). This file records what each step delivered and what is left.

## Step 1: an Embla row behind a switch

`<Workspace rowEngine="embla">` runs the row on `embla-carousel` 8.6.0 with `embla-carousel-wheel-gestures` 8.1.0 (both pinned
exactly: the later oval drag uses Embla's `internalEngine()`, which semver does not cover). The default is `'own'`, the row as
before; with the switch off nothing renders or listens differently.

What the switch does (`emblaRow.ts`, and a branch each in `Workspace.tsx` and `PanelRow.tsx`):

- The container carries `data-row-engine="embla"`, and the old row's wheel, touch and key listeners
  (`useRowScrollGesture`) and the Workspace's arrow-key edge focus return at once for it.
- The Workspace renders no `[data-row-window] > [data-row-strip]`, so the old row scroller finds no strip and draws nothing.
- `PanelRow` draws the same slots (the same `PanelRowSlot`, contexts, enter and exit animations) inside a window that is
  `fit` whole slots wide (`emblaWindowOf`), centered, and cut one gap past each edge as the old grid cut was. Its box is
  Embla's container, as wide as the window, and holds one zero-height marker per slot (`slotMarkerLefts`), which Embla takes
  as its slides: every slot edge is a stop, a wide panel's inner ones included (`align: 'start'`, `containScroll:
  'trimSnaps'`, `skipSnaps: true`).
- Wheel and trackpad: the wheel-gestures plugin on the window. A wheel handed in by `feedRowWheel` bubbles to the same listener,
  so it moves the row like a wheel over it; it returns true for a sideways wheel and false for a vertical one. Option held at a
  gesture's first event leaves the whole gesture to the content (a listener registered before the plugin's stops it).
- Pointer drag: Embla's own. A mouse press starts one only on the row's surface (a gap, not a panel), so a panel's text,
  controls and header grab keep the mouse; a touch starts one anywhere but on a control, an editable field or a frame.
- Arrow keys: a bare ArrowLeft or ArrowRight steps one slot (`scrollPrev`, `scrollNext`), under the old row's
  `arrowKeyBelongsElsewhere` filter.
- Focus: a panel focused while partly out of the window comes in by the least move.

Measured with `node --import tsx tools/proof/embla-row-proof.ts --engine embla` (headless Chromium 151, 1800 x 900, rows
narrow 24 x 1, wide 3,2,..., mixed 1,3,1,2,...; the Workspace panel is the strip's first slot):

Stalls are open. The probe page measured 0 of 149 on the same Embla options; on the real row a wheel event that arrives in a
frame sometimes moves nothing. Not yet diagnosed. The likely place is the wheel-gestures plugin's momentum guess: a constant
synthetic stream can read as momentum, which ends the drag (a release) and ignores the rest of the gesture until it goes
quiet. A real trackpad sends a different stream, so a hand check is part of the diagnosis.

The 1000 px step fails, and it is step 2's case, not a resize one: at 1000 px the window is two slots, so the three-slot panel
left of the view is clamped to two (`rowNumbers` draws no panel wider than the window). Every panel after it moves one slot
left and glides there on its own slot animation, while Embla keeps its stop number: the view's left-edge panel ends 406 px
left of the window and one-slot panels are cut for 25 frames of the glide. The keep-the-view-still rule (step 2) fixes this.

## Not done in step 1 (still on the old row, or not working on Embla yet)

- The dot bar reads the old row scroller, so its oval does not follow an Embla row, and a dot press moves nothing (step 3).
- Workspace summon, dismiss and step-aside (step 4); maximize and animated width changes (step 5); drag to reorder and its
  edge scroll (step 6).
- Parking (step 7): an Embla row shows the live panels `useProvidePanels` gives it on one strip; in a parking row the swap that
  brings parked panels in is driven by the old gesture, which stands aside, so scrolling ends at the last live panel.
- The keep-the-view-still rule for a width change left of the view, a panel opening or closing there, or a reorder (step 2).
- Anything that asks the old row scroller to move (`scrollOnOpen`, `revealOnScroll`, a host's `stepRow` chord, the settle after a
  hand resize) moves nothing on Embla.
- Edge-held panels (`edgeHold`) were not tried on Embla: the old drawing pass that holds them needs the old strip.
- Shift + vertical wheel is not read as sideways; a finger drag was not measured (headless has no touch stream); a real
  trackpad and Safari were not tried.
