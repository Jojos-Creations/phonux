# shared/phone: design notes

This folder is the seam between the app and any view -- Settings, History, a live web panel, or a future
third-party one. It is meant to split out into its own package/repo boundary eventually, so nothing here may
depend on the app that hosts it.

## Import boundary

`phoneViewApi.tsx`, and the rest of this folder, import only React, MUI, motion and itself -- never
`localStorage`, the desktop IPC bridge, or any other app-internal module. A view written against these
contracts must work under ANY host, not just this one.

## The provider is rebuilt every render

`PhoneAPIsProvider`'s `apis` value is never memoised, on either side: the host's handlers close over
render-time state (the panel list, the column count), so a memoised bag would hand a view a stale closure.

## Testing without a host

`phoneApisFake.ts` lives beside the contracts, not in the app's test folder, specifically so a third-party
view (with no access to the app's own test utilities) can still write a test against these APIs. It records
every call rather than simulating real behavior, since simulating real behavior would require importing the
app's own logic -- exactly what this boundary exists to avoid.

## Behavior flags cross this boundary as data only

The app's own panel model adds behavior flags (`collapsible`, `listed`, `view`, ...) to decide overflow,
listing and rendering -- but `PanelSummary` (this folder's own view of a panel) exposes only what a view
needs to render a row: id, url, title, live, locked. A view never sees or reasons about the flags that
decided whether a panel is in `panelList` at all.
